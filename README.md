The anomalous morphology of ECG hearbeats reflects pathological phenomena occuring during the hearbeat, which involves the electrical activity of the excitable cells of the myocardium. From a dataset of 105 patients with ECG recorded in a 30min interval, an AI-based model is built in order to perform real-time classification of the newly-recorded ECG signals. 

ECG sections are labelled as follows:
* NRS: Normal Sinus Rythm - Normal
* PAC: Premature Atrial Complex - Sopraventricular
* PVC: Premature Ventricular Complex - Ventricular

A two-lead example is displayed below:
